			<h2>Depression in America</h2>
			<p>According to the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 8.4% of Americans aged 18 and older experienced at least one depressive episode between 2019-2020. Though this may not seem like a high number, this data reflects real people and real struggles.
			</p>

		<div class="row">
			<h2>What This Number Means</h2>
			<p>Sometimes data doesn’t reflect the full picture – it’s hard to quantitatively measure the human condition. This project offers a data visualization tool to “re-humanize” this statistic. Use the drop-down menu below to generate your chosen number of profile pictures. Some of the profile photos will represent American adults who experienced a depressive episode in the past year, indicated by (they will look like this). Note: to experience the full effects of this visualization, this website is best viewed on a laptop screen or larger.</p>

			<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
			<p>To protect users’ privacy, none of the people in these photos are real. Instead, all profile images were generated from This Person Does Not Exist, an API that computes hyper-realistic images of fake people. In addition,
				the photos displayed are in no way representative of measured distributions amongst different demographic groups. Don't let this detract from the goal of this project – although all the photos used in this visualization are fake, they could just as easily be real.
